To create a simple todo app using Node.js and save the todos as JSON on the local filesystem, we will use the following packages:

2. body-parser: Middleware to parse the request body
3. fs: Built-in Node.js module to interact with the filesystem

First, let's create a package.json file to manage our dependencies:

package.json
